          <h2>About Thomas & FriendsðŸš‚</h2>
          <p class="about">Four friends all attending Bethel School Of Technology, who took the  
                    
          Full Stack Web Developer Program, came together to solve a real-world need. <br>Due to the 
          
          <span class="red">COVID19</span> Pandemic, communities and people around the country 
          
          have faced an unprecedented lack of the necessities that most people take for granted. <br> Because 
          
          of this pandemic, the team decided that for their final group project, they would focus on those 
          
          needs.  During the project proposal phase, the Lord put it on their hearts to create the City Care 
          
          App. The product will be an application that puts the resources in the hands of the community 
          
          and the community in touch with the resources to be able to meet those needs. </p>
